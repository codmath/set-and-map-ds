They are associative containers that store unique elements following a specific order.
SETS:
Stores the values in sorted order. 
Stores only unique values. 
Elements can only be inserted or deleted but cannot be modified. 
We can erase more than 1 element by giving the start iterator and end iterator position. 
Traversal using iterators. 
Sets are implemented as Binary Search Tree.
MULTISETS:
They are associative containers that store multiple elements having equivalent values following a specific order. Following are the properties of multisets:

Stores elements in sorted order. 
It allows the storage of multiple elements. 
We can erase more than 1 element by giving the start iterator and end iterator

UNORDERED SET:
They are associative containers that store unique elements in no particular order. Following are the properties of Unordered_sets: 

Elements can be stored in any order. ( no sorted order ) .
Stores only unique values. 
Hash-table used to store elements. 
We can erase only the element for which the iterator position is given.

UNORDERD MULTISET:
It is an associative container that contains a set of non-unique elements in unsorted order. Following are the properties of Unordered_multiset: 

Elements can be stored in any order. 
Duplicate elements can be stored. 
Hash-table used to store elements. 
We can erase only the element for which the iterator position is given
